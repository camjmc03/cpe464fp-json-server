to run server:
./json-server-<os_suffix>
./json-server-<os_suffix> <address>

Fun project. Learned alot about socket programming in C.

Note on the project structure. I wrote it in such a way that
it could read from requested files instead of responding from hard coded string literals
and then realized I could only turn in one .c file for the project. 
I might rewrite it for fun to read from files.
